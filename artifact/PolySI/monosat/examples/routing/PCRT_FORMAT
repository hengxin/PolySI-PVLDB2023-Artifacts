This is a summary of the PCRT format for describing constrained, grid-based circuit routing problems, a superset of the
one used for Alexander Nadel's paper "Routing Under Constraints" (FMCAD 2016).

Each .pcrt file describes:
        (a) A 2D grid (X,Y) where a vertex is associated with every grid point and an edge is created between every two
            adjacent vertices (more on this below).
        (b) A set of nets, each of which specifies two or more vertices to be routed to each other.
        (c) A set of mutually exclusive constraints, where each constraint is a list of 1 or more vids that cannot be
            routed simultaneously. A vertex ID for (x,y) is y*X+x.
        (d) A set of disabled vertices, which must not be routed.

The format is as follows:
		; 2D Grid definition (90-degree)
		G X Y; Comments
		; Nets
		N vid1 vid2 ... vidn; Comments
		; Constraints (at most one vertex routed)
		C vid1 vid2 ... vidn; Comments		
		; Disabled vertices
		D vid1; Comments

The file may have multiple 'N', 'C', and 'D' lines; there may be at most one 'G' line.
Each net 'N' describes two or more vertices that should be routed to each other.
Typically there are two vertices in each net, to be connected with an (acyclic) path.
If there are more than two vertices in a single net, then they may be connected by a tree.
There must not exist a path from the vertices a net to the vertices of any other net.

There are two types of constraints: C constraints and D constraints.
Each C constraint describes a set of mutually exclusive vertices: at most one of them can be routed in any solution.
Each D constraint describes a single disabled vertex (an obstacle) which must not be routed in any solution.

The pcrt file format supports 90-degree or 45-degree routing.
Grids defined using 'G X Y 90' headers support 90-degree routing. If the '90' is omitted, 90-degree routing is implied.
Grids may instead be defined using the header 'G X Y 45', in which case they support 45-degree routing.

Edges are implicitly defined in the pcrt format:
For 90-degree routing, each vertex has up to four undirected edges connecting it to its 4 cardinal neighbors.
For 45-degree routing, each vertex may have as many as 8 undirected edges, to its 4 cardinal and 4 diagonal neighbors.

An example .pcrt file follows between the dashed lines (which are not part of the .pcrt file):

The above file defining a 10 by 10 grid with 90-degree routing, two nets, one constraint, and two disabled vertices.
In a grid of width X, each vertex id V defines a tuple (x,y), with V=y*X+x.
Net 1 connects vid 40, which is located at position (0,4), to vid 48, located at position (8,4).
Net 2 connects vid 5, at (5,0) to vid 95, at (5,9).
The constraint asserts that at most one of vid 45, vid 30, and vid 23 may be routed. 
Those vertices are located at positions (5,4), (0,3), and (3,2).
The vertices with vid 62 and 63, at positions (2,6) and (3,6), are disabled, and must not be routed in the grid.

The following .pcrt file is the same as the above, except that it uses 45-degree routing (allowing diagonals):
